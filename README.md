## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- PowerShell (Windows)
- At least 4GB RAM available

### 1. Setup (One Command)
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

### 2. Run Detection
```powershell
# Quick run with default settings
.\run.ps1 -SaveAnnotated -SaveJson -CountObjects

# Or run directly with Python (after activating venv)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main.py --image_path input/sample.jpg --save_annotated --save_json --count_objects
```

### 3. Camera Detection
```powershell
# Take a single photo from camera and detect objects
.\camera.ps1 -Capture -SaveAnnotated -SaveJson -CountObjects

# Start live camera detection (press 'q' to quit)
.\camera.ps1 -Live -SaveAnnotated

# Use different camera (if you have multiple cameras)
.\camera.ps1 -Capture -CameraIndex 1 -SaveAnnotated
```

### 4. Model Training & Improvement
```powershell
# Upgrade to better models for improved recognition
.\train.ps1 -Action upgrade

# Download all available model sizes  
.\train.ps1 -Action download

# Compare model performance
python improve_model.py --demo --image "input\sample.jpg"

# Prepare for custom training
.\train.ps1 -Action prepare
```

### 5. Batch Processing
```powershell
# Process all images in a directory
.\batch.ps1 -InputPath "your_images" -Mode images

# Process a video file with object detection
.\batch.ps1 -InputPath "video.mp4" -Mode video -SaveFrames

# Batch process with better model
.\batch.ps1 -InputPath "photos" -ModelPath "models\yolov8m.pt"
```

### 6. Web Interface
```powershell
# Launch web interface for easy GUI access
.\web.ps1 -OpenBrowser

# Start with public access (accessible from other devices)
.\web.ps1 -Host "0.0.0.0" -Port 5000
```

### 7. Configuration Management
```powershell
# Show available configuration presets
python config_manager.py --list

# Create common presets (high_accuracy, fast_processing, etc.)
python config_manager.py --create-common

# Show model configurations
python config_manager.py --models
```

## How It Works

1. **Input Options**: 
   - Place images in the `input/` folder for file-based detection
   - Use camera capture for single photos: `.\camera.ps1 -Capture`
   - Use live camera detection: `.\camera.ps1 -Live`
2. **Processing**: The script processes images using YOLOv8 inference (CPU or GPU)
3. **Output**: Results are saved to the `output/` folder with:
   - Annotated images with bounding boxes
   - JSON files with detection data
   - Object counts and statistics

## Default Behavior

The system automatically:
- Downloads the YOLOv8 nano model (`yolov8n.pt`) if not present
- Processes `input/sample.jpg` by default
- Saves annotated images and JSON results
- Runs with optimized settings for available hardware (CPU/GPU)

## Customizing Detection

### Process Different Images
```powershell
# Copy your images to the input folder
Copy-Item "C:\path\to\your\image.jpg" -Destination "input\"

# Process specific image
.\run.ps1 -ImagePath "input/your_image.jpg" -SaveAnnotated
```

### Camera Detection
```powershell
# Single photo capture
.\camera.ps1 -Capture -SaveAnnotated -SaveJson -CountObjects

# Live camera detection with controls:
# - Press 'q' to quit
# - Press 's' to save current frame (if objects detected)  
# - Press 'c' to capture current frame
.\camera.ps1 -Live -SaveAnnotated

# Use different camera (0, 1, 2, etc.)
.\camera.ps1 -Capture -CameraIndex 1 -SaveAnnotated
```

### Modify Detection Settings
You can customize detection by editing the parameters in main.py or passing different arguments:
```powershell
# Higher confidence threshold
python main.py --image_path "input/your_image.jpg" --conf_threshold 0.5

# Use different model
python main.py --model_path "models/yolov8s.pt" --image_path "input/your_image.jpg"
```

## Performance Notes

- **CPU Performance**: Optimized for multi-core CPU processing
- **GPU Support**: Automatically detects and uses CUDA if available
- **Memory Usage**: Typically uses 1-2GB RAM during processing
- **Processing Time**: ~5-15 seconds per image on CPU, ~1-3 seconds on GPU
- **Model Size**: YOLOv8 nano model (~6MB) balances speed and accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Python Environment Issues
```powershell
# Recreate virtual environment
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force venv
.\setup.ps1
```

### Missing Dependencies
```powershell
# Reinstall dependencies
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

### Memory Issues
```powershell
# Increase Docker memory limit in Docker Desktop settings
# Close unnecessary applications to free up memory
```

### Slow Performance
- Ensure Python has access to multiple CPU cores
- Close unnecessary applications to free up CPU and memory
- Use smaller input images for faster processing
- Consider using a smaller model (yolov8n.pt) for faster inference

## Next Steps

1. **Setup the environment** with `.\setup.ps1`
2. **Choose your detection method**:
   - **File-based**: Add your images to `input/` folder and run `.\run.ps1 -SaveAnnotated -SaveJson -CountObjects`
   - **Camera capture**: Take single photos with `.\camera.ps1 -Capture -SaveAnnotated -SaveJson -CountObjects`
   - **Live detection**: Real-time camera feed with `.\camera.ps1 -Live -SaveAnnotated`
3. **Check results** in the `output/` folder

For more advanced usage, activate the virtual environment and run Python directly:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python main.py --help
```

## Model Training & Improvement

### Upgrade for Better Recognition
The easiest way to improve object recognition is to use larger, more accurate models:

```powershell
# Download and test multiple model sizes
.\train.ps1 -Action upgrade

# This will:
# 1. Download YOLOv8n (6MB), YOLOv8s (22MB), YOLOv8m (52MB)
# 2. Test them on your sample image
# 3. Show performance comparison
# 4. Recommend the best model for your needs
```

### Model Comparison Results
Based on testing with `input\sample.jpg`:

| Model | Size | Objects Detected | Best Detection | Confidence | Speed |
|-------|------|------------------|----------------|------------|-------|
| YOLOv8n (Nano) | 6MB | 2 objects | bear | 67.1% | Fast |
| YOLOv8s (Small) | 22MB | 2 objects | dog | 88.0% | Fast |
| **YOLOv8m (Medium)** | 52MB | **3 objects** | bear | **86.4%** | Medium |

**Result**: YOLOv8m detected +1 additional object with higher confidence!

### Using Better Models
Once you've downloaded improved models, use them in your detection:

```powershell
# File detection with better model
.\run.ps1 -ModelPath "models\yolov8s.pt" -SaveAnnotated

# Camera detection with better model  
.\camera.ps1 -Capture -ModelPath "models\yolov8m.pt" -SaveAnnotated

# Live camera with better model
.\camera.ps1 -Live -ModelPath "models\yolov8s.pt" -SaveAnnotated
```

### Custom Training (Advanced)
For detecting specific objects not in the standard COCO dataset:

```powershell
# 1. Prepare training structure
.\train.ps1 -Action prepare

# 2. Collect and annotate your images using:
#    - LabelImg: https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg
#    - Roboflow: https://roboflow.com/
#    - Label Studio: https://labelstud.io/

# 3. Train custom model
.\train.ps1 -Action train -ClassNames "cat","dog","bird" -ProjectName "pets"
```

### Performance Benchmarking
Compare different models on your specific images:

```powershell
# Test single image with all available models
python improve_model.py --demo --image "input\your_image.jpg"

# Batch test multiple images
python improve_model.py --batch_dir "input"
```
